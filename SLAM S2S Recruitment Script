I\\\u0027m writing this email to invite you to participate in SLAM\\\u0027s Student-to-student lessons program.  Every quarter, we pair talented teachers with members of the UCLA community for individual music lessons.  Because this program is entirely based on-campus, it offers Bruin musicians a unique opportunity to make an impact right here.  I encourage you to consider joining us this quarter!  Not only are Student-to-student lessons highly rewarding for both teachers and students, but by their nature, they are also very flexible.  You are only required to meet with your student once a week for an hour, whenever works best for you and your student.\\n\\nIf you are interested in getting involved or learning more about the program, please send me an email!\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nJason Mally\\nDirector of Student-to-student Lessons, SLAM at UCLA\u0027;\n  for (var i \u003d 1; i \u003c data.length; i++) {\n    (function(val) {\n      var row \u003d data[i];\n      var emailAddress \u003d row[1]; //position of email header — 1\n      var name \u003d row[0]; // position of name header — 1\n      var message \u003d \u0027Hi \u0027 + name + \u0027,\\n\\n\u0027 + text;\n      var subject \u003d \u0027SLAM Student-to-Student Lessons: PLEASE JOIN!\u0027;\n      MailApp.sendEmail(emailAddress, subject, message);\n      })(i);\n   }\n\n}\n"},{"id":"1831fb7f-c72e-4e61-bbf5-b80f4b642f68","name":"appsscript","type":"json","source":"{\n  \"timeZone\": \"America/Los_Angeles\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n  },\n  \"exceptionLogging\": \"STACKDRIVER\"\n}"}]}
